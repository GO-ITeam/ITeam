		<h1>Threats impacting forest health</h1>
		<p>By <span class="author_name">Laura Olivieri</span> Aug. 20, 2015 , 2:15 PM</p>
		<p>Forests are vital. They help prouce the oxygen we breathe and sequester the carbon that is warming the planet. But what happens when forest health starts to decline? This week’s Science special issue on forest health explores that question, and examines threats facing forests around the globe—both natural and human-caused.</p>

		<h2>1.Wildﬁre</h2>
		<p>Fire is a natural part of forest ecosystems, and the boreal forests of the far north are no stranger to ﬂames. One widespread boreal tree, the black spruce, owes its success to an adaption to ﬁre. The spruce’s seeds are locked away in cones that only open up when they get singed. The seeds secure a new generation of spruce after a wildﬁre has swept through a forest. But increasingly hot summers are favoring more intense and frequent wildﬁres, a trend that makes it harder for new spruce to sprout.</p>
