	<h1>Meet the college dropout who invented the gravitational wave detector</h1>
	<p class="article_details">By Adrian ChoAug. 4, 2016 , 9:00 AM</p>
	<p>Nearly 50 years ago, Rainer Weiss dreamed up a way to detect <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/topic/gravitational-waves" target="blank"> gravitational waves </a> — infinitesimal ripples in spacetime predicted by Einstein’s theory of gravity, general relativity. Last September, that dream came true as 1000 physicists working with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (<abbr title="Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory">LIGO</abbr>), two huge detectors in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, sensed a pulse of waves radiated by two massive black holes as they spiraled into each other a billion light-years away. The discovery makes Weiss, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (<abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr>) in Cambridge, a sure bet to win a Nobel Prize, his peers say. Weiss, 83, acknowledges the prospect with some apprehension. <q>It will fuck me up for a year,</q> he predicts as he nimbly steers his silver Volkswagen Beetle ragtop through Cambridge traffic. <q>That’s what it did to John Mather.</q> The line is vintage “Rai,” his friends will tell you: blunt, irreverent, funny, and impatient with anything that gets in the way of his work.
